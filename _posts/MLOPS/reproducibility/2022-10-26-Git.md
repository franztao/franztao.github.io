## 直觉

无论是单独工作还是与团队合作，重要的是有一个系统来跟踪项目的更改，以便可以恢复到以前的版本，以便其他人可以复制工作并为它做出贡献。[Git](https://git-scm.com/)是一个分布式版本控制系统，它允许这样做。Git 在计算机上本地运行，它会跟踪文件及其历史记录。为了与他人协作，可以使用远程主机（[GitHub](https://github.com/)、[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/)、[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/)等）来托管文件及其历史记录。将使用 git 推送本地更改并将其他人的更改拉入和拉出远程主机。

> Git 传统上用于存储和版本化小于 100MB 的小文件（脚本、自述文件等），但是，仍然可以使用指向 blob 存储的文本指针来版本化大型工件（数据集、模型权重等）。[这些指针将包含诸如资产所在位置、特定内容/版本（例如通过散列）等信息。将在版本控制](https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/versioning/)课程中看到这一点，将创建一个指向特定版本的指针数据集和模型。

## 设置

### 初始化 git

![git环境](https://madewithml.com/static/images/mlops/git/environments.png)

初始化一个本地存储库（`.git`目录）来跟踪文件：

```
在 /Users/goku/Documents/madewithml/MLOps/.git/ 中初始化空的 Git 存储库

```

可以看到哪些文件未跟踪或尚未提交：

```
在分支主

还没有提交

未跟踪的文件：
  （使用“混帐添加..." to include in what will be committed)
        .flake8
        .vscode/
        Makefile
        ...

```

### .gitignore

We can see that we have some files that we don't want to push to a remote host, such as our virtual environment, logs, large data files, etc. We can create a `.gitignore` file to make sure we aren't checking in these files.

We'll add the following files to the file:

```
# Data
logs/
stores/
data/

# Packaging
venv/
*.egg-info/
__pycache__/

# Misc
.DS_Store

```

For now, we're going to add `data` to our `.gitignore` file as well but this means that others will not be able to produce the same data assets when they pull from our remote host. To address this, we'll push pointers to our data files in our [versioning lesson](https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/versioning/) so that the data too can be reproduced exactly as we have it locally.

Tip

Check out our project's [.gitignore](https://github.com/GokuMohandas/mlops-course/blob/main/.gitignore) for a more complete example that also includes lots of other system artifacts that we would normally not want to push to a remote repository. Our complete `.gitignore` file is based on GitHub's [Python template](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Python.gitignore) and we're using a [Mac](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/macOS.gitignore), so we added the relevant [global](https://github.com/github/gitignore/tree/main/Global) file names as well.

If we run `git status` now, we should no longer see the files we've defined in our `.gitignore` file.

### Add to stage

Next, we'll add our work from the working directory to the staging area.

-   We can add one file at a time:
-   We can add all files at once:

Now running `git status` will show us all the staged files:

```
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached ..." to unstage)
        new file:   .flake8
        new file:   .gitignore
        new file:   Makefile
        ...

```

### Commit to repo

Now we're ready to commit the files in the staging area to the local repository. The default branch (a version of our project) will be called `main`.

```
git commit -m "added project files"

```

```
[main (root-commit) 704d99c] added project files
 47 files changed, 50651 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 .flake8
 create mode 100644 .gitignore
 create mode 100644 Makefile
 ...

```

The commit requires a message indicating what changes took place. We can use `git commit --amend` to edit the commit message if needed. If we do a `git status` check we'll see that there is nothing else to commit from our staging area.

```
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean

```

### Push to remote

现在准备将更新从本地存储库推送到远程存储库。[首先在GitHub](https://github.com/) （或任何其他远程存储库）上创建一个帐户，然后按照[说明](https://github.com/new)创建一个远程存储库（它可以是私有的或公共的）。在本地存储库中，将设置用户名和电子邮件凭据，以便可以将更改从本地存储库推送到远程存储库。

```
# Set credentials via terminal
git config --global user.name <USERNAME>
git config --global user.email <EMAIL>

```

可以快速验证是否设置了正确的凭据，如下所示：

```
# Check credentials
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email

```

接下来，需要在本地和远程存储库之间建立连接：

```
# Push to remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPOSITORY_NAME>.git
git push -u origin main  # pushing the contents of our local repo to the remote repo
                         # origin signifies the remote repository

```

## 发展

现在准备开始添加到项目并提交更改。

### 克隆

如果（或其他人）还没有设置本地存储库并与远程主机连接，可以使用克隆命令：

```
git clone <REMOTE_REPO_URL> <PATH_TO_PROJECT_DIR>

```

And we can clone a specific branch of a repository as well:

```
git clone -b <BRANCH> <REMOTE_REPO_URL> <PATH_TO_PROJECT_DIR>

```

-   `<REMOTE_REPO_URL>` is the location of the remote repo (ex. https://github.com/GokuMohandas/mlops-course).
-   `<PATH_TO_PROJECT_DIR>` is the name of the local directory you want to clone the project into.

### Create a branch

When we want to add or change something, such as adding a feature, fixing a bug, etc., it's always a [best practice](https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/git/#best-practices) to create a separate branch before developing. This is especially crucial when working with a team so we can cleanly merge our work with the `main` branch after discussions and reviews.

We'll start by creating a new branch:

```
git checkout -b <NEW_BRANCH_NAME>

```

We can see all the branches we've created with the following command where the \* indicates our current branch:

```
* convnet
main

```

We can easily switch between existing branches using:

```
git checkout <BRANCH_NAME>

```

Once we're in a branch, we can make changes to our project and commit those changes.

```
git add .
git commit -m "update model to a convnet"
git push origin convnet

```

Note that we are pushing this branch to our remote repository, which doesn't yet exist there, so GitHub will create it accordingly.

### Pull request (PR)

When we push our new branch to the remote repository, we'll need to create a pull request (PR) to merge with another branch (ex. our `main` branch in this case). When merging our work with another branch (ex. main), it's called a pull request because we're requesting the branch to _pull_ our committed work. We can create the pull request using steps outlined here: [Creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

![在 github 上合并](https://madewithml.com/static/images/mlops/git/merge_gh.png)

Note

We can merge branches and resolve conflicts using git CLI commands but it's preferred to use the online interface because we can easily visualize the changes, have discussion with teammates, etc.

```
# Merge via CLI
git push origin convnet
git checkout main
git merge convnet
git push origin main

```

### Pull

Once we accepted the pull request, our `main` branch is now updated with our changes. However, the update only happened on the remote repository so we should pull those changes to our local `main` branch as well.

```
git checkout main
git pull origin main

```

### Delete branches

Once we're done working with a branch, we can delete it to prevent our repository from cluttering up. We can easily delete both the local and remote versions of the branch with the following commands:

```
# Delete branches
git branch -d <BRANCH_NAME>  # local
git push origin --delete <BRANCH_NAME>  # remote

```

## Collaboration

So far, the workflows for integrating our iterative development has been very smooth but in a collaborative setting, we may need to resolve conflicts. Let's say there are two branches (`a` and `b`) that were created from the `main` branch. Here's what we're going to try and simulate:

1.  Developer A and B fork the `main` branch to make some changes
2.  Developer A makes a change and submits a PR to the `main` branch.
3.  Developer B makes a change to the same line as Developer A and submits a PR to `main`.
4.  We have a merge conflict now since both developers altered the same line.
5.  Choose which version of the code to keep and resolve the conflict.

When we try to merge the second PR, we have to resolve the conflicts between this new PR and what already exists in the `main` branch.

![解决github上的冲突](https://madewithml.com/static/images/mlops/git/resolve.png)

We can resolve the conflict by choosing which content (current `main` which merged with the `a` branch or this `b` branch) to keep and delete the other one. Then we can merge the PR successfully and update our local `main` branch.

```
<<<<<< BRANCH_A
<CHANGES FROM BRANCH A>
======
<CHANGES FROM BRANCH B>
>>>>>> BRANCH_B

```

Once the conflicts have been resolved and we merge the PR, we can update our local repository to reflect the decisions.

```
git checkout main
git pull origin main

```

Note

We only have a conflict because both branches were forked from a previous version of the `main` branch and they both happened to alter the same content. Had we created one branch first and then updated main before creating the second branch, we wouldn't have any conflicts. But in a collaborative setting, different developers may fork off the same version of the branch anytime.

> A few more important commands to know include [rebase](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) and [stash](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash).

## Inspection

Git allows us to inspect the current and previous states of our work at many different levels. Let's explore the most commonly used commands.

### Status

We've used the status command quite a bit already as it's very useful to quickly see the status of our working tree.

```
# Status
git status
git status -s  # short format

```

### Log

If we want to see the log of all our commits, we can do so using the log command. We can also do the same by inspecting specific branch histories on the Git online interface.

```
# Log
git log
git log --oneline  # short version

```

```
704d99c (HEAD -> main) added project files

```

> Commit IDs are 40 characters long but we can represent them with the first few (seven digits is the default for a Git SHA). If there is ambiguity, Git will notify us and we can simply add more of the commit ID.

### Diff

If we want to know the difference between two commits, we can use the diff command.

```
# Diff
git diff  # all changes between current working tree and previous commit
git diff <COMMIT_A> <COMMIT_B>  # diff b/w two commits
git diff <COMMIT_A>:<PATH_TO_FILE> <COMMIT_B>:<PATH_TO_FILE>  # file diff b/w two commits

```

```
diff --git a/.gitignore b/.gitignore
index 288973d..028aa13 100644
--- a/.gitignore
+++ b/.gitignore
@@ -1,7 +1,6 @@
 # Data
 logs/
 stores/
-data/

```

### Blame

One of the most useful inspection commands is blame, which allows us to see what commit was responsible for every single line in a file.

```
# Blame
git blame <PATH_TO_FILE>
git blame -L 1,3 <PATH_TO_FILE>  # blame for lines 1 and 3

```

## Time travel

Sometimes we may have done something we wish we could change. It's not always possible to do this in life, but in the world of Git, it is!

### Restore

Sometimes we may just want to undo adding or staging a file, which we can easily do with the _restore_ command.

```
# Restore
git restore -- <PATH_TO_FILE> <PATH_TO_FILE> # will undo any changes
git restore --stage <PATH_TO_FILE>  # will remove from stage (won't undo changes)

```

### Reset

Now if we already made the commit but haven't pushed to remote yet, we can reset to the previous commit by moving the branch pointer to that commit. Note that this will undo all changes made since the previous commit.

```
# Reset
git reset <PREVIOUS_COMMIT_ID>  # or HEAD^

```

> `HEAD` is a quick way to refer to the previous commit. Both `HEAD` and any previous commit ID can be accompanied with a `^` or `~` symbol which acts as a relative reference. `^`n refers to the nth parent of the commit while `~`n refers to the nth grandparent. Of course we can always just explicitly use commit IDs but these short hands can come in handy for quick checks without doing `git log` to retrieve commit IDs.

### Revert

But instead of moving the branch pointer to a previous commit, we can continue to move forward by adding a new commit to revert certain previous commits.

```
# Revert
git revert <COMMIT_ID> ...  # rollback specific commits
git revert <COMMIT_TO_ROLLBACK_TO>..<COMMIT_TO_ROLLBACK_FROM>  # range

```

### Checkout

Sometimes we may want to temporarily switch back to a previous commit just to explore or commit some changes. It's best practice to do this in a separate branch and if we want to save our changes, we need to create a separate PR. Note that if you do checkout a previous commit and submit a PR, you may override the commits in between.

```
# Checkout
git checkout -b <BRANCH_NAME> <COMMIT_ID>

```

## Best practices

There so many different works to work with git and sometimes it can became quickly unruly when fellow developers follow different practices. Here are a few, widely accepted, best practices when it comes to working with commits and branches.

### Commits

-   Commit often such that each commit has a clear associated change which you can approve / rollback.
-   Try and [squash](https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/git/#squash) commits if you have multiple before pushing to the remote host.
-   Avoid monolithic commits (even if you regularly stash and rebase) because it can cause many components to break and creates a code review nightmare.
-   Attach meaningful messages to commits so developers know exactly what the PR entails.
-   Use tags to represent meaningful and stable releases of your application.
    
    ```
    # Tags
    git tag -a v0.1 -m "initial release"
    
    ```
    
-   Don't delete commit history (reset), instead use [revert](https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/git/#revert) to rollback and provide reasoning.

### Branches

-   Create branches when working on a feature, bug, etc. because it makes adding and reverting to the `main` branch very easy.
-   Avoid using cryptic branch names.
-   Maintain your `main` branch as the "demo ready" branch that always works.
-   Protect branches with [rules](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-a-branch-protection-rule) (especially the `main` branch).

### Tags

Leverage git [tags](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) to mark significant release commits. We can create tags either through the terminal or the online remote interface and this can be done to previous commits as well (in case we forgot).

```
# Tags
git tag  # view all existing tags
git tag -a <TAG_NAME> -m "SGD"  # create a tag
git checkout -b <BRANCH_NAME> <TAG_NAME>  # checkout a specific tag
git tag -d <TAG_NAME>  # delete local tag
git push origin --delete <TAG_NAME>  # delete remote tag
git fetch --all --tags  # fetch all tags from remote

```

> 标签名称通常遵循版本命名约定，例如`v1.4.2`数字从左到右表示主要、次要和错误更改。
